## 🤔 Discovery of the Day
Testing wins again. 

Testing forces proof of functionality being simply "working". Something can work but do so incorrectly. Setting a determinist test result and then checking the diff between expected and got forces the truth of the code to the surface. 

Additionally it forces you to think through the code structure and what is actually happening step by step. 

### ✅ Learnings
1. I should have abstracted redundant code sooner to add clarity to the more complicated service functions, like `CreateConversations()` and `AppendConversations()`. As it stands, those sections are far noisier than I first realized when I started writing. 

### 🔁 TODO
- Fix the `conversation/service.go` create and append funcs to properly create, enumarate, and store questions/messages. 
- Abstract wherever possible to avoid redundancy and maintain clarity. 
- Check the test factories to make sure they are deterministically outputting what we expect the data to look like. 
- Fix tests and run to pass as needed.
