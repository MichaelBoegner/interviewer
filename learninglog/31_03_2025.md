# March 29, 2025 – Learning Log

## 🤔 Discovery of the Day
How do you test for timestamps, like created_at/updated_at, when there is bound to be a differential of milliseconds between test suite and prod, due to compiling order. 

### ✅ Learnings
1. `cmpopts` package offers the `func cmpopts.EquateApproxTime(margin time.Duration) cmp.Option` which allows for a margin of acceptable differential time to be passed. 


See docs: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts 

### 🔁 TODO
- Apply to ConversationHandlers integration test.
