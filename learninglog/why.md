# Learning Log - Why?

A while back, I noticed that every morning when I first look at my codebase, I have a question that I seek an answer to. As a result, I started a google doc journal where I enter those questions/answers every day, dated. I was thinking that I should start publishing these daily as a means to show my thought process and growth as I continue to build. I have a backlog in google docs that I'll slowly be transfering over as well.
