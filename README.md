# Interviewer App

**An intelligent, interactive mock interview platform powered by Go and React, designed to help users confidently prepare for technical interviews.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Interviewer App provides users with a dynamic technical interviewing experience powered by conversational AI (ChatGPT). The system presents one question at a time in a structured interview format. Future updates will introduce progress tracking, scoring, and personalized feedback to enhance user insights.

## 🎯 Features

- **Structured Mock Interviews:** Conduct interviews with sequential, dynamically generated technical questions.
- **Interactive Conversational AI:** Powered by OpenAI’s GPT models for natural, context-aware dialogue.
- **JWT-based Authentication:** Secure user authentication and session management.
- **Efficient Architecture:** Built with a Go backend (HTTP handlers, PostgreSQL, and robust middleware) and a React frontend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component      | Technology                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Backend        | Go (Golang), HTTP Handlers   |
| Database       | PostgreSQL                   |
| Authentication | JWT-based authentication (access & refresh tokens) |
| AI Integration | OpenAI GPT API               |
| Testing        | Unit Tests (Go)              |

## 🚧 Upcoming Improvements

- Standardized Error Handling
- Middleware Separation (Authentication & Authorization)
- Enhanced Unit & Integration Testing
- Optimized Database Queries (using JOINs)
- Structured Logging and Monitoring
- UI for progress tracking and scoring.
- More detailed analytics and visualization tools.
- Implementing integration testing and automated end-to-end tests.
